How to Play:
  
EAT IT: A snake constantly moves around the board.
It is your goal to control the direction the "head" of the snake moves, either up, down,
left or right in a 2D playing field.
You must get the snake to eat apples that randomly appear on the screen.
You do this by hitting the apple with the snakes head.
Eating an apple causes the snake to grow in length, one unit at a time and your score increases by one.
The game ends if the snake crashes into the edge of the board, itself or random blocks (lily or
or sand-stone blocks) that may appear and your lives are reduced to zero.
As the game progresses you may obtain power ups by eating special golden apples that slow the speed,
earn double points for 20 seconds, obtain invincibility for 20 seconds or gain a bonus life.
  
  
Goodluck!
